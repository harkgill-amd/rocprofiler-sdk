# ROCprofiler-SDK buffered services

In the buffered approach, the internal (background) thread sends callbacks for batches of records.
Supported buffer record categories are enumerated in `rocprofiler_buffer_category_t` category field and supported buffer tracing services are enumerated in  `rocprofiler_buffer_tracing_kind_t`. Configuring
a buffered tracing service requires buffer creation. Flushing the buffer implicitly or explicitly invokes a callback to the tool, which provides an array of one or more buffer records.
To flush a buffer explicitly, use `rocprofiler_flush_buffer` function.

## Subscribing to buffer tracing services

During tool initialization, the tool configures callback tracing using `rocprofiler_configure_buffer_tracing_service`
function. However, before invoking `rocprofiler_configure_buffer_tracing_service`, the tool must create a buffer for the tracing records as shown in the following section.

### Creating a buffer

```cpp
rocprofiler_status_t
rocprofiler_create_buffer(rocprofiler_context_id_t        context,
                          size_t                          size,
                          size_t                          watermark,
                          rocprofiler_buffer_policy_t     policy,
                          rocprofiler_buffer_tracing_cb_t callback,
                          void*                           callback_data,
                          rocprofiler_buffer_id_t*        buffer_id);
```

Here are the parameters required to create a buffer:

- `size`: Size of the buffer in bytes, which is rounded up to the nearest
memory page size (defined by `sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE)`). The default memory page size on Linux
is 4096 bytes (4 KB).

- `watermark`: Specifies the number of bytes at which the buffer should be flushed. To flush the buffer, the records in the buffer must invoke the `callback` parameter to deliver the records to the tool. For example, for a buffer of size 4096 bytes with the watermark set to 48 bytes, six 8-byte records can be placed in the
buffer before `callback` is invoked. However, every 64-byte record that is placed in the
buffer will trigger a flush. It is safe to set the `watermark` to any value between
zero and the buffer size.

- `policy`: Specifies the behavior when a record is larger than the
amount of free space in the current buffer. For example, for a buffer of size 4000 bytes with the watermark set to 4000 bytes and 3998 bytes populated with records, the `policy` dictates how to handle an incoming record greater than 2 bytes. If the environment variable `ROCPROFILER_BUFFER_POLICY_DISCARD` is enabled, all records greater than 2 bytes are dropped until the tool _explicitly_ flushes the buffer using `rocprofiler_flush_buffer` function call whereas, if the environment variable `ROCPROFILER_BUFFER_POLICY_LOSSLESS` is enabled, the current buffer is swapped out for an empty buffer and placed in the new buffer while the former (full) buffer is _implicitly_ flushed.

- `callback`: Invoked to flush the buffer.

- `callback_data`: Value passed as one of the arguments to the `callback` function.

- `buffer_id`: Output parameter for the function call to contain a
non-zero handle field after successful buffer creation.

### Creating a dedicated thread for buffer callbacks

By default, all buffers use the same (default) background thread created by ROCprofiler-SDK to
invoke their callback. However, ROCprofiler-SDK provides an interface to allow the tools to create an additional background thread for one or more of their buffers.

To create callback threads for buffers, use `rocprofiler_create_callback_thread` function:

```cpp
rocprofiler_status_t
rocprofiler_create_callback_thread(rocprofiler_callback_thread_t* cb_thread_id);
```

To assign buffers to that callback thread, use `rocprofiler_assign_callback_thread` function:

```cpp
rocprofiler_status_t
rocprofiler_assign_callback_thread(rocprofiler_buffer_id_t       buffer_id,
                                   rocprofiler_callback_thread_t cb_thread_id);
```

**Example:**

```cpp
{
    // create a context
    auto context_id = rocprofiler_context_id_t{0};
    rocprofiler_create_context(&context_id);

    // create a buffer associated with the context
    auto buffer_id  = rocprofiler_buffer_id_t{};
    rocprofiler_create_buffer(context_id, ..., &buffer_id);

    // specify that a new callback thread should be created and provide
    // and assign the identifier for it to the "thr_id" variable
    auto thr_id = rocprofiler_callback_thread_t{};
    rocprofiler_create_callback_thread(&thr_id);

    // assign the buffer callback to be delivered on this thread
    rocprofiler_assign_callback_thread(buffer_id, thr_id);
}
```

### Configuring buffer tracing services

To configure buffer tracing services, use:

```cpp
rocprofiler_status_t
rocprofiler_configure_buffer_tracing_service(rocprofiler_context_id_t          context_id,
                                             rocprofiler_buffer_tracing_kind_t kind,
                                             rocprofiler_tracing_operation_t*  operations,
                                             size_t                            operations_count,
                                             rocprofiler_buffer_id_t           buffer_id);
```

Here are the parameters required to configure buffer tracing services:

- `kind`: A high-level specification of the services to be traced. This parameter is also known as "domain".
Domain examples include, but not limited to, the HIP API, HSA API, and kernel dispatches.

- `operations`: For each domain, there are often various `operations` that can be used to restrict the callbacks to a subset within the domain. For domains corresponding to APIs, the `operations` are the functions
composing the API. To trace all operations in a domain, set the `operations` and `operations_count`
parameters to `nullptr` and `0` respectively. To restrict the tracing domain to a subset
of operations, the tool library must specify a C-array of type `rocprofiler_tracing_operation_t` for `operations` and size of the array for the `operations_count` parameter.

Similar to the `rocprofiler_configure_callback_tracing_service`,
`rocprofiler_configure_buffer_tracing_service` returns an error if a buffer service for the specified context
and domain is configured more than once.

**Example:**

```cpp
{
    auto ctx = rocprofiler_context_id_t{};
    // ... creation of context, etc. ...

    // buffer parameters
    constexpr auto KB          = 1024;  // 1024 bytes
    constexpr auto buffer_size = 16 * KB;
    constexpr auto watermark   = 15 * KB;
    constexpr auto policy      = ROCPROFILER_BUFFER_POLICY_LOSSLESS;

    // buffer handle
    auto buffer_id = rocprofiler_buffer_id_t{};

    // create a buffer associated with the context
    rocprofiler_create_buffer(
        context_id, buffer_size, watermark, policy, callback_func, nullptr, &buffer_id);

    // configure HIP runtime API function records to be placed in buffer
    rocprofiler_configure_buffer_tracing_service(
        ctx, ROCPROFILER_BUFFER_TRACING_HIP_RUNTIME_API, nullptr, 0, buffer_id);

    // configure kernel dispatch records to be placed in buffer
    // (more than one service can use the same buffer)
    rocprofiler_configure_buffer_tracing_service(
        ctx, ROCPROFILER_BUFFER_TRACING_KERNEL_DISPATCH, nullptr, 0, buffer_id);

    // ... etc. ...
}
```

## Buffer tracing callback function

Here is the buffer tracing callback function:

```cpp
typedef void (*rocprofiler_buffer_tracing_cb_t)(rocprofiler_context_id_t      context,
                                                rocprofiler_buffer_id_t       buffer_id,
                                                rocprofiler_record_header_t** headers,
                                                size_t                        num_headers,
                                                void*                         data,
                                                uint64_t                      drop_count);
```

The `rocprofiler_record_header_t` data type contains the following information:

- `category` (`rocprofiler_buffer_category_t`): The `category` is used to classify the buffer record. For all
services configured via `rocprofiler_configure_buffer_tracing_service`, the `category` is equal to the value of `ROCPROFILER_BUFFER_CATEGORY_TRACING`. The other available categories are `ROCPROFILER_BUFFER_CATEGORY_PC_SAMPLING` and `ROCPROFILER_BUFFER_CATEGORY_COUNTERS`.

- `kind`: The `kind` field is dependent on the `category`. For example, for `category` `ROCPROFILER_BUFFER_CATEGORY_TRACING`, the value of `kind` depicts the tracing type such as HSA core API in `ROCPROFILER_BUFFER_TRACING_HSA_CORE_API`.

- `payload`: The `payload` is casted after the category and kind have been determined.

```cpp
{
    if(header->category == ROCPROFILER_BUFFER_CATEGORY_TRACING &&
        header->kind == ROCPROFILER_BUFFER_TRACING_HIP_RUNTIME_API)
    {
        auto* record =
            static_cast<rocprofiler_buffer_tracing_hip_api_record_t*>(header->payload);

        // ... etc. ...
    }
}
```

**Example:**

```cpp
void
buffer_callback_func(rocprofiler_context_id_t      context,
                     rocprofiler_buffer_id_t       buffer_id,
                     rocprofiler_record_header_t** headers,
                     size_t                        num_headers,
                     void*                         user_data,
                     uint64_t                      drop_count)
{
    for(size_t i = 0; i < num_headers; ++i)
    {
        auto* header = headers[i];

        if(header->category == ROCPROFILER_BUFFER_CATEGORY_TRACING &&
           header->kind == ROCPROFILER_BUFFER_TRACING_HIP_RUNTIME_API)
        {
            auto* record =
                static_cast<rocprofiler_buffer_tracing_hip_api_record_t*>(header->payload);

            // ... etc. ...
        }
        else if(header->category == ROCPROFILER_BUFFER_CATEGORY_TRACING &&
                header->kind == ROCPROFILER_BUFFER_TRACING_KERNEL_DISPATCH)
        {
            auto* record =
                static_cast<rocprofiler_buffer_tracing_kernel_dispatch_record_t*>(header->payload);

            // ... etc. ...
        }
        else
        {
            throw std::runtime_error{"unhandled record header category + kind"};
        }
    }
}
```

## Buffer tracing record

Unlike callback tracing records, there is no common set of data for each buffer tracing record. However,
many buffer tracing records contain a `kind` and an `operation` field.
You can obtain the value for the `kind` of tracing using `rocprofiler_query_buffer_tracing_kind_name` function and the value for the `operation` specific to a tracing kind using the `rocprofiler_query_buffer_tracing_kind_operation_name`
function. You can also iterate over all the buffer tracing `kinds` and `operations` for each tracing kind using the
`rocprofiler_iterate_buffer_tracing_kinds` and `rocprofiler_iterate_buffer_tracing_kind_operations` functions.

The buffer tracing record data types are available in the [rocprofiler-sdk/buffer_tracing.h](https://github.com/ROCm/rocprofiler-sdk/blob/amd-mainline/source/include/rocprofiler-sdk/buffer_tracing.h) header.

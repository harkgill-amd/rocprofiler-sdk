### Added

**API:**

- Input YAML support for counter collection
- Input JSON support for counter collection
- Application replay in counter collection
- `rocprofv3` multi-GPU support:

### Changed

- `rocprofv3` tool now requires mentioning `--` before the application. For detailed use, see [Using rocprofv3](source/docs/how-to/using-rocprofv3.rst)

### Resolved issues

- Fixed `SQ_ACCUM_PREV` and `SQ_ACCUM_PREV_HIRE` overwriting issue

## ROCprofiler-SDK 0.4.0 for ROCm release 6.2 (AFAR VI)

### Added

- OTF2 tool support
- Kernel and range filtering
- Counter collection definitions in YAML
- Documentation updates (SQ block, counter collection, tracing, tool usage)
- `rocprofv3` option `--kernel-rename`
- `rocprofv3` options for Perfetto settings (buffer size and so on)
- CSV columns for kernel trace
  - `Thread_Id`
  - `Dispatch_Id`
- CSV column for counter collection

### Additions
   --List supported PC Sampling Configurations
### Changes

### Added

- Start and end timestamp columns to the counter collection csv output
- Check to force tools to initialize context id with zero
- Support to specify hardware counters for collection using rocprofv3 as `rocprofv3 --pmc [COUNTER [COUNTER ...]]`
- Memory Allocation Tracing
- PC sampling tool support with CSV and JSON output formats

### Changed

- `--marker-trace` option for `rocprofv3` now supports the legacy ROCTx library `libroctx64.so` when the application is linked against the new library `librocprofiler-sdk-roctx.so`.
- Replaced deprecated `hipHostMalloc` and `hipHostFree` functions with `hipExtHostAlloc` and `hipFreeHost` for ROCm versions starting 6.3.
- Updated `rocprofv3` `--help` options.
- Changed naming of "agent profiling" to a more descriptive "device counting service". To convert existing tool or user code to the new name, use the following sed:
`find . -type f -exec sed -i 's/rocprofiler_agent_profile_callback_t/rocprofiler_device_counting_service_callback_t/g; s/rocprofiler_configure_agent_profile_counting_service/rocprofiler_configure_device_counting_service/g; s/agent_profile.h/device_counting_service.h/g; s/rocprofiler_sample_agent_profile_counting_service/rocprofiler_sample_device_counting_service/g' {} +`
- Changed naming of "dispatch profiling service" to a more descriptive "dispatch counting service". To convert existing tool or user code to the new names, the following sed can be used: `-type f -exec sed -i -e 's/dispatch_profile_counting_service/dispatch_counting_service/g' -e 's/dispatch_profile.h/dispatch_counting_service.h/g' -e 's/rocprofiler_profile_counting_dispatch_callback_t/rocprofiler_dispatch_counting_service_callback_t/g' -e 's/rocprofiler_profile_counting_dispatch_data_t/rocprofiler_dispatch_counting_service_data_t/g'  -e 's/rocprofiler_profile_counting_dispatch_record_t/rocprofiler_dispatch_counting_service_record_t/g' {} +`
- `FETCH_SIZE` metric on gfx94x now uses `TCC_BUBBLE` for 128B reads.
- PMC dispatch-based counter collection serialization is now per-device instead of being global across all devices.
- Added output return functionality to rocprofiler_sample_device_counting_service
- Added rocprofiler_load_counter_definition.

### Resolved issues

- Create subdirectory when `rocprofv3 --output-file` includes a folder path
- Fixed misaligned stores (undefined behavior) for buffer records
- Fixed crash when only scratch reporting is enabled
- Fixed `MeanOccupancy` metrics
- Fixed aborted-application validation test to properly check for `hipExtHostAlloc` command
- Fixed implicit reduction of SQ and GRBM metrics
- Fixed support for derived counters in reduce operation
- Bug fixed in max-in-reduce operation
- Introduced fix to handle a range of values for `select()` dimension in expressions parser
- Conditional `aql::set_profiler_active_on_queue` only when counter collection is registered (resolves Navi3 kernel tracing issues)

### Removed

- Removed gfx8 metric definitions
- Removed `rocprofv3` installation to sbin directory

## ROCprofiler-SDK 0.5.0 for ROCm release 6.4

### Added

- Added support for select() operation in counter expression.
- Added reduce operation for counter expression wrt dimension.
- `--collection-period` feature added in rocprofv3, to enable filtering using time.
- `--collection-period-unit` feature added in rocprofv3, to allow the user to control time units used in collection period option.
- Added deprecation notice for rocprofiler(v1) and rocprofiler(v2).
